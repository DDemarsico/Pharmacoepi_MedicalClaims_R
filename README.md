The goal of this repository is to store all information and code relating to the claims data project done for Pharmacoepidemiology. 

The primary aim is two-fold: to run a time-to-event analysis comparing the rate of which Parkinson's Disease patients develop dyskinesia while using either Levodopa monotherapy or Levodopa dual therapy with Rasagiline.

The secondary analysis is to run a spatial analysis to determine if there are regional differences in prescribing habits for monotherapy and dual therapy.
